## project description
Unsupervised learning aims at representing structure in the input data, often by means of features. The 
resulting features can be used as input for classification tasks or as initialization for further supervised 
learning. Traditional principal component analysis, factor analysis and independent component analysis 
are some examples. Deep learning methods including autoencoders, variational inference, variational 
autoencoders and GAN models are also developed.
